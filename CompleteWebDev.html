                A tip for Development: We are adviced to use heading tags the way they are supposed to and that is in defining a headig or sub-heading or a sub-sub heading and not to just change the size of the text or to just bold out text in that way the SEO of the webpage gets effected also there should only be a single heading in a single webpage.

                <br>
                It is adviced to use Strong instead of bold just a modern coding practise
